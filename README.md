# music21_example_webapp
This is the source code for the webapp which  currently runs at musescore1983.pythonanywhere.com.

With this webapp I could upload a midi of "For Elise" and download this piece: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjOcuflV6uM
The link above is not guaranted to run forever though.
